### Task2 *Hack me #2: Errors + Hack me #6: SQL Injection*

Your task is to go to our quite vulnerable web shop, and find a way to make it show you an error that was not intended for you to see. For example, instead of saying "Oh-oh, something went wrong", the web app would show you, for example, a full stack trace of a failed database query.

Your task is to find a way to perform an SQL Injection attack on our broken web shop, and have it show you a list of usernames and passwords. The resulting list should contain only usernames and passwords, no extra info.
